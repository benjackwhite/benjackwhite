### Hi, I'm Ben White 👋

I am a tech leader, consultant, entrepreneur, full-stack software engineer and a below-average musician.

When I'm not busy building apps in the cloud I can be found roaming the beautiful streets of München loading up on some of the best food on offer or sipping a fine liesl beer. You can follow me if you like, send me a message or reach out about working with me.
